# Return Values

# Function doesn't always display its output directly
#   Value a function returns is called a return value
#       The return statement akes a value from inside a function
#           and sends it back to the line that called the function

# Return values allow you to move much of your program's grunt work
#   into functions, which can simplify the body of your program
